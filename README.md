# today-scheduled

## Description

A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. All 

- To help re-inforce foundational coding knowledge I have built a day scheduler web application.
- Overall this project helps individuals keep track of their busy day.
- During this project I traversed the DOM using jQuery. Additionally I worked with event listeners and timing. I also worked with bootstrap to style the page. Finally, local browser storage was used to store and retrieve information.
